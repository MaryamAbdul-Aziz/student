## Agile Methodology Manifesto

// #1,#2,#5,#6,#7,#9,#12

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customerâ€™s competitive advantage.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Our principles
1. Our highest priority is to provide continuous, valuable software to our teacher
2. We welcome change to our projects, even late in development.
